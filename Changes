0.03 2013-09-20
    - Changed SYNOPSIS and doc to make it clear that you should require at

      given the changes from 0.01 to 0.02
    - Added SEE ALSO section with links to
            Parse::CPAN::Packages

    - Now process 02packages and transform into a format where all modules
      in a release are encoded in JSON and recorded on one line.
      Thanks to DAGOLDEN for the suggestion to use JSON.
    - We only hold onto the latest release for each dist
    - Dropped EntryIterator as it no longer makes sense

0.01 2013-08-26
    - first release to CPAN
